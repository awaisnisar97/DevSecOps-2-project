# DevSecOps Pipeline for a Netflix-like Application  

This project involves the creation of a **DevSecOps pipeline** for deploying a Netflix-like application on the cloud. The pipeline is designed to integrate containerization, security, automation, monitoring, and GitOps practices to ensure a streamlined, scalable, and secure deployment process. Below are the key steps and components of the project:

---

## Project Workflow  

1. **EC2 Instance Deployment**  
   - Launch an **AWS EC2 instance** to host the application locally during the initial testing phase.  
   - The application is containerized using **Docker** to ensure consistent and portable deployments.  

2. **Integrating Security**  
   - Use **SonarQube** for static code analysis to identify vulnerabilities and maintain code quality.  
   - Incorporate **Trivy** to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before pushing them to the container registry.  

3. **CI/CD Automation with Jenkins**  
   - Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the Docker container using **Jenkins**.  
   - **Jenkins Pipeline** handles:  
     - Building Docker images.  
     - Scanning for security vulnerabilities.  
     - Uploading secure images to **Docker Hub**.  
   - Jenkins integrates with **SMTP** to send email notifications for success or failure of build and deployment jobs.  

4. **Monitoring and Observability**  
   - Implement **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring and observability.  
     - **EC2 Instance Monitoring**: Track system metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and network traffic.  
     - **Jenkins Job Monitoring**: Visualize success/failure rates and identify pipeline bottlenecks.  
   - Alerts are configured for critical thresholds to ensure proactive responses.  

5. **Deploying to Kubernetes**  
   - Use **Helm Charts** to simplify the deployment of Kubernetes clusters.  
   - Deploy the containerized application onto the Kubernetes cluster for high availability and scalability.  

6. **GitOps with ArgoCD**  
   - Implement **ArgoCD** to automate and manage Kubernetes deployments using GitOps principles.  
   - All application manifests and configurations are stored in a Git repository, providing transparency and version control.  

7. **Cloud-hosted Netflix-like Application**  
   - The final application, resembling Netflix in design and functionality, is hosted on the cloud.  
   - Both the application and the Kubernetes cluster are monitored using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to ensure reliability and scalability.

## Key Features  

- **End-to-end Automation**: Automate the entire build, security, and deployment pipeline using Jenkins and ArgoCD.  
- **Integrated Security**: Incorporate tools like SonarQube and Trivy to maintain high security standards.  
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Real-time observability of EC2 instances, Jenkins pipelines, and Kubernetes clusters using Prometheus and Grafana.  
- **Scalability and Resilience**: Deploy the application on Kubernetes for scalable, resilient cloud-hosted operations.  
- **GitOps Workflow**: Ensure controlled and versioned application deployments using ArgoCD and Git repositories.  

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: For containerization of the application.
- **AWS EC2**: To run the application locally during testing.
- **Jenkins**: For CI/CD automation.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and observability.
- **Kubernetes**: For application orchestration.
- **Helm Charts**: To simplify Kubernetes deployments.
- **ArgoCD**: For GitOps-based workflow automation.
